      title: "Thermosensitive Rings",
      description: "I came up with the idea to make annuloplasty rings out of shape memory materials. Two versions made of out different materials were made, which demonstrated promise in allowing for minimally invasive annuloplasty surgeries as well as pediatric applications for mitral valve regurgitation in patients.",
